                Git. Create a remote git repository on GitHub. You can make your repository public; but if you make it private, then add me as a collaborator (my GitHub id is csusbdt).
                Create a Web page with any content you like. Place your code in a file named index.html and add it to your remote repository. 
                Include a link to your remote repository in your next progress report.

                This is my first time experimenting with HTML and CSS. I do have a little experience
                with Javascript, however it's on my job's Game Development Platform designed for kids 
                between the ages of 8-15. I look forward to diving deeper into Javascript, HTML, and CSS in this course.
